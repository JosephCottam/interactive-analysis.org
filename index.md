title: "DSIA: Data Systems for Interactive Analysis"
---

This is the website for the Workshop on Data Systems for
Interactive Analysis (DSIA). The [first edition of DSIA](/year/2015/) was held at
[IEEE VIS 2015](http://ieeevis.org/year/2015/info/vis-welcome/welcome),
with Joe Hellerstein as the keynote speaker and more than 150 attendees. 

We are thrilled to announce a second edition of the workshop, to be
held at [IEEE VIS 2017](http://ieeevis.org).

DSIA brings together researchers at the intersection of databases,
machine learning, and interactive visualization. These three areas
have important things to say to each other. Modern data visualization
depends on the cutting edge of both database and machine learning
research: database researchers are exploring techniques for storing
and querying massive amounts of data; machine learning techniques
provide ways to discover unexpected patterns and to automate and scale
well-defined analysis procedures.
 
This workshop explores the idea that the next generation of database,
machine learning, and interactive visualization systems should not be
designed in isolation. For example, machine learning techniques might
recommend improved data transformation and visual encoding
decisions. Or, database query optimizers might take advantage of
perceptual constraints, while prefetching methods reduce latency by
modeling likely interactions. This workshop seeks to jump start
cross-pollination between these fields.

## Topics

This workshop will focus on interactive systems: techniques,
methods, architecture, systems that enable the user to interactively
explore and analyze large amounts of data in the back end with
little or no latency. We encourage late-breaking work,
research in progress, and position papers in interactive analysis,
broadly construed. For example, topics of interest to the workshop include (but are not limited to):

* design of database architectures for interactive analysis
* novel database applications for interactive analysis
* novel database techniques based on perceptual constraints and
  human-centered design
* evaluation of database systems for interactive analysis
* identify unique characteristics of databases for supporting visualization
* communication protocols between front and back ends
* techniques for data storage, retrieval, compression, transformation,
  sampling, and streaming
* techniques for metadata generation
* front-end architectures that exploit these novel back-end capabilities

We are interested, more generally, in the questions that arise at the
*intersection* of these systems.
